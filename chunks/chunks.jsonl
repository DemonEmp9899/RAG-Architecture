Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search\nspace. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process,\nlacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper,\nwe propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved\ntext-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning\nprocess through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training\nmethods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning\ncan result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient\nexploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address\nthese issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-\nCSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process\nand utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames,\nthereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct\ndatasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty\nand improve temporal search capabilities.

Temporal search lies at the heart of making long-video understanding\nboth accurate and interpretable (Park et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2025). In contrast to the\nhuman visual system, which conducts adaptive temporal search (Yarbus, 1967; Hayhoe & Ballard,\n2005), current large video-language models (LVLMs) primarily rely on hand-crafted search strategies\nwith static frame sampling (Lin et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2025a; Feng et al., 2025). Humans naturally\nalternate between broad scanning and targeted inspection, refining their focus iteratively based on\nintermediate findings (Castelhano & Henderson, 2007; Henderson & Hayes, 2017). In contrast,\nexisting methods are limited to a fixed set of frames established before the reasoning process begins. This design presents a fundamental contradiction: video reasoning is a dynamic process where\ntemporal search interleaves with video reasoning; however, the video frames accessible to the model\nremain fixed from the outset, ultimately hindering effective reasoning. ∗Equal contribution. †Project lead.

VideoAgent (Wang et al., 2024) first employs a large language model\n(LLM) as the central agent, which iteratively calls tools like vision-language models (VLMs) and\nCLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for frame captioning and retrieval, and then aggregates information in the\ntextual modality to perform reasoning and predict answers. T* (Ye et al., 2025) extends this paradigm\nby introducing an object-oriented spatial-temporal search. It first leverages a VLM to extract target\nobjects from the question, then employs object detection models (e.g., YOLO (Cheng et al., 2024))\nto identify keyframes containing these objects, and finally uses the retrieved frame set to complete\nthe task. Moreover, strategies that introduce tree-structured search to improve efficiency have also\nbeen explored (Wang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025). However, all of these approaches\ndepend on manually designed workflows, which lead to suboptimal search strategies. This motivates us to explore an end-to-end learning approach that discovers optimal temporal search\nstrategies directly from data. In this work, we reformulate the temporal search task as an interleaved\ntext-video thinking process, and propose TIMESEARCH-R, a model that learns to actively search for\nrelevant temporal clips through reinforcement learning (RL).

Under review. 2.1\nTASK FORMULATION\nTemporal Search within Thinking Process. To learn optimal search strategies directly from data,\nwe reformulate temporal search as a multi-turn thinking process interleaved with video clip retrieval. Given a video V and a corresponding question Q, an initial preview ˜V is uniformly sampled from V\nfor subsequent reasoning. At each thinking step k, the policy model πθ generates a textual reasoning\nTk. If Tk contains a search instruction, the video environment executes it according to frame\ntimestamps, retrieving a clip Vk ⊆V that is appended to the ongoing chain of thought (CoT) as input\nfor later steps. The interleaved text-video CoT at reasoning step k is formalized as:\nCk ≜{ (T1, V1), (T2, V2), . . . , (Tk, Vk) }. (1)\nThis interaction process repeats until the model emits the final answer A or reaches the pre-defined\nreasoning budget. For further analysis, the entire reasoning chain can be decomposed into two\ncomponents: temporal search and answer prediction, which can be formulated as:\nPθ(A, C | ˜V , Q) = Pθ(C | ˜V , Q)\n|\n{z\n}\nTemporal Search\n· Pθ(A | C, ˜V , Q)\n|\n{z\n}\nAnswer Prediction\n.

During the interleaved thinking process, the model autonomously explores\nthe video by searching for additional clips. At reasoning step k, if the model outputs a search\ninstruction, it is also required to specify the temporal boundaries tk\ns and tk\ne to be explored, along\nwith a corresponding textual query qk. The video environment then executes a frame retrieval\nfunction to obtain additional F frames Vk = search(V ; tk\ns, tk\ne, qk, F) = {f 1\nk, f 2\nk, . . . , f F\nk }. This\nfunction serves as an interface to the policy model πθ, employing a small VLM (e.g., SigLIP (Zhai\net al., 2023)) to calculate the similarity among frames within the specified temporal clip [tk\ns, tk\ne], as\nwell as the relevance with the textual query qk. The most informative F frames are then sampled\nusing determinantal point process (DPP) (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012), which has been widely used\nfor information retrieval (Chen et al., 2018; Celis et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2025). This operation\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of temporal search, and more details can be found in Section A. 2.2\nGRPO WITH COMPLETENESS SELF-VERIFICATION\nEvaluating temporal search typically requires frame-level annotations (Ye et al., 2025), which are time-\nconsuming and labor-intensive. To circumvent this challenge, previous works (Yu et al., 2025; Sun\net al., 2025) have treated downstream video understanding task as a surrogate metric for assessing the\nsearched frame set. However, these approaches are limited to selecting an optimal subset from a pre-\ndefined pool of candidate frames, lacking interaction with and exploration of the video environment. Inspired by this, we design a Completeness Self-Verification (CSV) mechanism for GRPO, which\nis annotation-free and can be seamlessly integrated into RL training, serving as a complementary to\nthe original outcome reward.

The overall pipeline of GRPO-CSV is illustrated in Figure 3. GRPO-CSV. We introduce CSV as a complement to GRPO with only outcome rewards. During the\nGRPO rollout phase, the policy model πθ generates a text-video interleaved CoT C and a final answer\nA. Applying rewards only to the final answer may reduce the effectiveness of intermediate search\nprocesses. To address this, we extract the video clips from C to form a dynamic frame set Vc as the\ninput for the CSV phase. In the CSV rollout phase, the same policy model is required to re-answer\nthe question Q using only Vc, yielding a CSV answer Ac. Critically, the model is prohibited from\nany further temporal searching and must rely solely on the currently searched frames to answer the\nquestion. The CSV answer Ac is expected to remain consistent with the original answer A:\nPθ(Ac | Vc, Q) ≈Pθ(A | C, ˜V , Q). (3)\nCompleteness Reward. We design a completeness reward for the CSV phase, which is computed\nusing the original answer A, the CSV answer Ac, and the ground-truth answer A∗as follows:\nRc = 1[Acc(A, A∗) > 0.5] · Acc(Ac, A∗). (4)\nwhere Acc(A, A∗) and Acc(Ac, A∗) denote the correctness scores of the original answer and the\nCSV answer, respectively, and 1[·] is an indicator function activated only when the original answer A\nis correct. This conditional design ensures that the CSV reward is applied only to promising reasoning\ntrajectories, encouraging meaningful temporal search while verifying both the sufficiency of acquired\nvisual evidence and the consistency between the reasoning process and the final answer. 4\nPreprint.

The format reward enforces adherence to a predefined schema through-\nout the multi-turn reasoning process, validating the structural integrity of the entire tra-\njectory rather than individual steps.

For multiple-choice questions,\nwe extract the option letter from the model’s output and perform an exact match with the ground-truth\noption. For open-ended questions, we adopt an LLM-as-a-Judge approach (Zheng et al., 2023) to\nassess the semantic agreement between the model’s final answer and the reference answer.

A fundamental challenge in RL for long-video reasoning lies in the fact that\na large number of samples in the existing datasets can be solved through pure linguistic bias, reducing\nthe reliance on temporal search. Moreover, some noisy samples remain unsolvable even under\nideal temporal search, preventing the model from effectively exploring the video. To address these\nchallenges, we implement a two-stage data filtering pipeline to construct a high-quality dataset tailored\nto video reasoning. In the first stage, we remove samples that the policy model can solve correctly\nusing only 4 uniformly sampled frames, thereby discouraging reliance on linguistic shortcuts. In the\nsecond stage, we further discard samples that remain unsolvable even with multiple temporal searches\nand numerous video frames, ensuring active video exploration. Additional details of this filtering\npipeline are provided in Section B.1. And we enhance dataset diversity through the incorporation\nof samples sourced from Haystack-Ego4D (Ye et al., 2025), VideoMarathon (Lin et al., 2025), and\nCinePile (Rawal et al., 2024).

To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of TimeSearch-R, we compare it against\nthree types of baselines: (1) Advanced foundation models with static frame sampling, including\nboth API models (OpenAI, 2024; Team et al., 2024) and open-source models (Bai et al., 2025a). (2)\nState-of-the-art temporal search agents, such as VideoAgent (Wang et al., 2024), T* (Ye et al., 2025),\nand VideoTree (Wang et al., 2025). (3) Video reasoning models like Video-R1 (Feng et al., 2025). Datasets. We evaluate TimeSearch-R on two tasks: (1) Temporal search on Haystack-LVBench\nand Haystack-Ego4D (Ye et al., 2025), where the task is modeled as long video needle-in-a-haystack,\nmeasuring temporal and visual similarity as well as QA accuracy. (2) Long-form video understanding\non VideoMME (Fu et al., 2024), MLVU (Zhou et al., 2024), and LongVideoBench (Wu et al., 2024). Evaluation Metrics. Besides the original metrics used in the benchmarks, we additionally introduce\ntwo metrics to assess the quality of the text-video interleaved thinking process for ablation study. Among them, completeness measures whether the searched frame set is sufficient for the correct\nanswer, while consistency measures the alignment between intermediate reasoning and the final\nanswer. Further details on these two metrics are provided in Section D. Implementation Details. We train TimeSearch-R based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al.,\n2025a). In the RL training, we use the AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) optimizer with a learning\nrate of 1e-6, a KL penalty coefficient β = 0.005, and a batch size of 4 with 8 rollouts per prompt.

For the needle-in-a-haystack QA, our TimeSearch-R consistently outperforms\nthe advanced API model GPT-4o, achieving 52.1% accuracy on Haystack-LVBench and 53.5% on\nHaystack-Ego4D. These results demonstrate the superiority of end-to-end learned temporal search\nstrategies over handcrafted workflows based on human heuristics. Long-Form Video Understanding. Our TimeSearch-R also achieves strong performance on the\nlong-form video understanding task, which is shown in Table 2. On VideoMME, our method reaches\nan overall accuracy of 66.6%, surpassing the base model Qwen2.5-VL by 1.5%. As the duration of\nthe video increases, our method can achieve more gains, from 0.5% on short videos to 1.4% on long\nvideos, demonstrating that temporal search becomes more valuable when the video length increases. On MLVU and LongVideoBench, TimeSearch-R achieves 71.5% and 60.1%, improving over the\nbase model by 1.3% and 4.1%, respectively.

SFT allows the model\nto rapidly acquire temporal search skills, dramatically improving temporal F1 from 0.0 to 7.8 and\nsearched frame completeness from 44.2% to 60.5%. (2) RL enhances video reasoning: While RL\nprovides modest improvements to temporal similarity and search completeness, its primary advantage\nlies in boosting overall understanding performance.

Traditional video understanding methods rely\non static frame sampling, such as uniform sampling or heuristic-based strategies (Li et al., 2024;\nChen et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025a), which fail to adapt to varying information density and evolving\nreasoning contexts. Recent work has explored more sophisticated mechanisms. Similarity-based\nmethods like KeyVideoLLM (Liang et al., 2024) achieve significant compression while maintaining\nperformance , while learning-based approaches such as Frame-Voyager (Yu et al., 2025) rank frame\ncombinations based on prediction losses, emphasizing task-specific selection. Advanced semantic\nframeworks have emerged to address temporal dependencies. Logic-in-Frames (Guo et al., 2025)\ndefines logical relations including spatial co-occurrence and temporal proximity to guide dynamic\nframe sampling. T* (Ye et al., 2025) reframes temporal search as spatial search with adaptive zooming\nmechanisms. Interactive agents like VideoAgent (Wang et al., 2024) and VideoTree (Wang et al.,\n2025) enable multi-turn temporal exploration through prompt-driven orchestration. However, none of\nthe aforementioned methods adopt end-to-end optimization, resulting in suboptimal search strategies. Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Reasoning.

Approaches like MM-Eureka (Meng et al., 2025) and LMM-R1 (Peng et al., 2025) have successfully\napplied RL to enhance multimodal reasoning, but focus primarily on static image understanding rather\nthan dynamic video interaction. Video-R1 (Feng et al., 2025) applies GRPO to video reasoning but\nlimits the thinking process to prue text without visual interaction, while DeepEyes (Zheng et al., 2025)\nuses RL for high-resolution image understanding through adaptive cropping operations but focuses\non spatial rather than temporal exploration. Despite these advances, applying RL to interactive long\nvideo understanding remains largely unexplored and presents unique challenges. 5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we propose TimeSearch-R, a framework that reformulates temporal search as text-video\ninterleaved thinking to learn optimal search strategies directly from data. To enhance temporal search\nthrough RL, we propose CSV as a complement to the outcome-only reward of GRPO, addressing the\nchallenges of insufficient temporal exploration and inconsistent logical reasoning. TimeSearch-R\nachieves strong performance on both temporal search and long-form video understanding tasks,\nwhile exhibiting distinct search patterns across different task types. We hope this work contributes\nmeaningful progress toward advancing long video understanding powered by reinforcement learning. 9\nPreprint. Under review.

TIMESEARCH-R: ADAPTIVE TEMPORAL SEARCH FOR\nLONG-FORM VIDEO UNDERSTANDING\nVIA SELF-\nVERIFICATION REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\nAPPENDIX\nThis appendix provides more details about our methods, dataset, training, more case studies, broader\nimpacts, as well as the LLM usage, organized as follows:\n• Section A: Search Function\n• Section B: Dataset Details\n• Section C: Prompt Design\n• Section D: Evaluation Metrics\n• Section E: Efficiency Analysis\n• Section F: Training Details\n• Section G: More Case Studies\n• Section H: Boarder Impacts\n• Section I: LLM Usage\nA\nSEARCH FUNCTION\nA.1\nFRAME SELECTION\nThe video search function selects the most informative frames within predicted temporal clips. Specifically, we leverage determinantal point process (DPP) (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012) as the search\noptimization for its ability to naturally balance query relevance and diversity that penalizes redundancy,\nwhich has been widely applied in information retrieval (Celis et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2025). Recall the definition of search in Sec. 2.1, it aims to select F optimal frames guided by a temporal\nclip [ts, te] and a query q from the original video V . First, the function first subsamples N candidate\nframes F[ts,te] = {vi}N\ni=1 within the temporal clip. Subsequently, we obtain a visual embedding\nhi ∈Rd for each candidate frame in F[ts,te], and a query embedding q ∈Rd for q. Then we define the\npairwise cosine similarity for candidate frames as Sij = h⊤\ni hj and compute an unnormalized query\nrelevance score for each frame as ˜ri = q⊤hi, which is rescaled to [0, 1] by min-max normalization\nri =\n˜ri−min ˜r\nmax ˜r−min ˜r+ϵ, where ϵ is a small constant to avoid division by zero.", "start_char": 48204, "end_char": 50075, "source_path": "data\\2511.05489v1.pdf"}

The kernel is constructed\nby diagonal conditioning with these relevance weights:\n˜L = diag(r) S diag(r),\n(6)\nwhich is equivalent to ˜Lij = rirj h⊤\ni hj. The optimal subset V ∗⊂F[ts,te] with |V ∗| = F is then\nobtained through fast greedy MAP inference (Chen et al., 2018):\nV ∗= arg\nmax\nS⊆F[ts,te],|S|=F det(˜LS). (7)\nThis formulation ensures that selected frames are both diverse and relevant to the query. When\navailable frames are fewer than F, the search function degrades to uniform temporal sampling. A.2\nFRAME REPRESENTATION\nThe selected clip frames are sparse and non-uniform. To maintain the temporal pace, we attach an\nexplicit absolute timestamp to each frame by inserting a short text token with the time in seconds\n(e.g., “12.3s”) immediately before the image. This simple interleaving of timestamp text and the\ncorresponding image maintains absolute temporal grounding when inter-frame intervals vary and\n13\nPreprint. Under review.

B\nDATASET DETAILS\nB.1\nDATASET CONSTRUCTION\nTo ensure high-quality training data, we implement a two-stage filtering pipeline as shown in Fig. 6. Stage 1: Visual Dependency Filtering. We uniformly sample 4 frames from each video and\nfeed them along with the question to Qwen2.5-VL for inference. Questions that can be correctly\nanswered with this limited visual information are considered to have low visual dependency and are\nsubsequently filtered out. Only questions requiring richer visual context proceed to the next stage. Stage 2: Search Usefulness Filtering. We increase the frame input to up to 64 frames and em-\nploy different LVLMs to perform dynamic temporal search for question-relevant video segments. Specifically, we use GPT-4o to generate SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data and an early version\nof TimeSearch to obtain RL (Reinforcement Learning) training data. Although this stage produces\nCoT, only the CoT generated by GPT-4o is used for SFT training, while RL training utilizes only the\nquestion-answer pairs. To avoid search format errors, we implement format validation for LVLMs’\nresponses, automatically retrying the model until obtaining properly formatted answers. Human Selection for VideoMarathon (Panda-70M). Given that VideoMarathon’s training set\ncontains automatically generated question-answer pairs with potential unanswerable questions or\nincorrect ground-truth answers, we conduct manual annotation to ensure data quality.

B.2\nDATASET ANALYSIS\nThe dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution in video duration with a mean length of 1,659\nseconds. Most videos are shorter than 2,000 seconds, while a nontrivial tail extends beyond one hour,\nposing significant challenges for static frame sampling.

Panda-70M\nfrom VideoMarathon (Lin et al., 2025) accounts for 35.6%, expanding the variety of internet videos\nwith heterogeneous motion patterns and scene dynamics. CinePile (Rawal et al., 2024) provides 9.5%\nof short videos with narrative structure and rapid scene transitions. The remaining 5.4% are from\nother sources and serve to reduce distributional bias. Question types are intentionally imbalanced toward open-ended reasoning to better evaluate generative\ncapabilities. Open-ended questions make up 60.3% of the data and emphasize step-by-step analysis,\ntemporal grounding, and explanation quality. Multiple-choice questions comprise 39.7% and offer\nreliable automatic evaluation signals that complement outcome rewards in RL. This composition yields wide coverage over motion intensity, scene diversity, and narrative structure\nwhile maintaining sufficient automatic evaluability. The mixture of long-tail durations and open-\nended questions creates a setting where end-to-end RL and adaptive temporal search offer clear\nbenefits over single-shot heuristics. 15\nPreprint.

However, these models exhibit limitations in capturing spatial relationships from sequential visual\nobservations [72, 75]. This spatial understanding ability is a foundational component of general intelligence,\npresents across a broad spectrum of animals, including humans [28, 48]. The deficiency significantly constrains\ncurrent VLMs to effectively interact with the physical world, thereby limiting their application in fields such\nas robotics [8, 86], autonomous driving [59], and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) [25]. To mitigate this\nissue, several studies have explored the incorporation of additional expert encoders [6, 22]. However, this\napproach often introduces extra complexity and can negatively impact the general capabilities of the models. Alternatively, other research efforts have focused on the development of specialized datasets [11, 19, 47, 69,\n77, 82], aiming to enhance the spatial understanding abilities of VLMs. ∗Equal contribution. 1\narXiv:2511.05491v1 [cs.CV] 7 Nov 2025\nMethod\nData Type\nData Usage\nSI\nMI\nVideo\nSFT\nRL\nSpatialVLM [11]\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\nSAT [49]\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\nMM-Spatial [19]\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\nSPAR [82]\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✗\nSpace-R [47]\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✓\nVLM-3R [22]\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\nVST (ours)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTable 1 Comparison with spatial dataset.", "start_char": 1473, "end_char": 3344, "source_path": "data\\2511.05491v1.pdf"}

Nevertheless, these arts have typically concentrated on limited or isolated aspects of spatial understanding. As\nsummarized in Table 1, some studies focus only on the supervised fine-tuning stage, while others are restricted\nto the single scenario, overlooking the diversity of visual input. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive\nand integrated framework, termed Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), which is designed to holistically cultivate\nhuman-like visuospatial abilities in VLMs. As illustrated in Figure 1, VST effectively augments the spatial\ncapabilities of existing VLMs through the construction of an extensive and carefully curated dataset. This\nenhancement proves advantageous for downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks. To develop the VST, we deconstruct spatial ability into two key components: spatial perception and spatial\nreasoning. We define spatial perception as the ability to discern the spatial relationships between objects,\nand spatial reasoning as the ability to build and mentally manipulate an internal model of an environment. These two components correspond to the concepts of perceptual and conceptual spatial ability, respectively,\nas proposed in cognitive science [48]. Effective spatial perception requires the model to possess foundational\nspatial knowledge—specifically, the ability to identify both \"what is it?\" and \"where is it?\" within its\nperipersonal space.", "start_char": 3144, "end_char": 5010, "source_path": "data\\2511.05491v1.pdf"}

Effective spatial perception requires the model to possess foundational\nspatial knowledge—specifically, the ability to identify both \"what is it?\" and \"where is it?\" within its\nperipersonal space. While existing VLMs can accurately recognize objects and locate them within pixel\nspace using 2D points or bounding boxes [3, 20, 62], their ability to determine object positions in 3D space\nremains limited [41, 60]. Therefore, we introduce the VST-Perception (VST-P) dataset, comprising 4.1 million\nsamples across 19 diverse tasks. The dataset incorporates single-image data to facilitate VLMs in discerning\nspatial relationships beyond the pixel level, which is an essential step towards bridging the gap between pixel\nspace and 3D space. In addition, multi-image data is included to enhance the ability to comprehend spatial\nrelationships from multiple viewpoints, and video data enables the capture of spatiotemporal relationships. Collectively, this dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for advancing spatial perception in VLMs. Beyond foundational spatial perception, we expect the model to mentally represent spatial relationships\nbeyond its own body, thereby engaging in advanced spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce the VST-\nReasoning (VST-R) dataset, which comprises samples featuring chain-of-thought (CoT) processes to facilitate\nthe spatial reasoning ability, as well as samples with rule-checkable answers to further enhance its reasoning\ncapabilities. In spatial reasoning, we place particular emphasis on multi-image scenarios, as these necessitate\nthe model’s ability to identify connections among objects and cameras, and to mentally reconstruct spatial\nlayouts.

For instance, Qwen2.5VL-3B [3] fine-tuned\non our VST yields an 8.6% improvement on the LIBERO benchmark [35]. 2\nDataset\nIn this section, we introduce the VST dataset, specifically developed to enhance the spatial perception\nand reasoning capabilities of VLMs. First, we construct a large-scale dataset, VST-Perception (VST-P), to\nequip VLMs with comprehensive spatial knowledge. Building upon this foundation, we further create the\nVST-Reasoning (VST-R) dataset to enable VLMs to reason in space. 2.1\nVST-Perception\nAs illustrated in Figure 2a, the VST-P dataset contains 4.1 M samples across 19 different tasks for supervised\nfine-tuning, covering three primary vision scenarios, i.e., single-image, multi-image, and video.

Since monocular images are easily obtainable, single-image data constitutes the largest category. This category primarily encompasses tasks such as relative depth estimation (2.5D), 3D object detection, and\ndistance estimation. These tasks bridge the gap between 2D pixel coordinates and the 3D physical world,\nthereby facilitating the acquisition of spatial knowledge and the development of spatial awareness in VLMs. To collect this data, we create dedicated data engines to gather data with depth maps and data with 3D\nbounding box annotations, as shown in the top left of Figure 3. The depth data mainly comes from public\ndatasets and synthetic data. The open-source data originates from ScanNet++ [76], which is collected using\nreal-world devices, and Hypersim [50], which is generated by a simulator. To increase the diversity of depth\ndata, we use a depth expert model [73] to create pseudo labels for wild images from the COCO dataset [34]. After obtaining the depth maps, we convert them to the same coordinate system and generate depth-related\nvisual instruction samples. The reference formats for depth-related samples encompass text-based, point-based,\nbox-based, and visual-prompt-based representations. These diverse formats enable VLMs to infer the relative\ndistance from objects to the camera plane. For the 3D data engine, we use two main approaches. The first approach relies on open-source datasets,\nincluding ScanNet [18], ARKitScenes [4], Hypersim [50], SUN-RGBD [54], Matterport3D [10], and Objectron [2].

With the\nlarge-scale data with 3D bounding boxes, we create visual instruction samples for 3D object detection, 3D\ngrounding, attribute measurement, and distance estimation tasks. In the 3D object detection task, we predict the 9-DoF bounding box in the camera coordinate system. Specifically, the 3D bounding box is defined by (x, y, z, xl, yl, zl, p, y, r), where (x, y, z) are the box center,\n(xl, yl, zl) are the length along the X, Y, and Z axes, and (p, y, r) are the rotation angles. However, a significant\nchallenge in utilizing datasets aggregated from disparate sources is the inherent variability in camera intrinsics,\nwhich introduces geometric inconsistencies that can hinder model generalization and scalability. To mitigate\nthis issue, we introduce a Field of View (FoV) unification strategy. This approach normalizes the input\ndata by projecting all images onto a virtual camera with a predefined, uniform FoV. This process creates a\nstandardized visual input, akin to data captured by a single virtual camera, thereby eliminating intrinsic-\nrelated discrepancies for the 3D object detection task. In addition, when creating the instruction data, we\nmix single-turn and multi-turn formats.

To obtain such scene captions, we prompt a large VLM [27] with ground-truth\n3D bounding boxes and object relationships extracted from the scene graph [85]. The resulting captions\nnot only describe the objects present in the image, but also provide detailed layout information and spatial\narrangements. Multi-image.

These tasks are designed to enhance VLMs to comprehend spatial relationships across different\nviewpoints. As illustrated in the third data engine of Figure 3, we sample multi-image data from RGB-D\nscans sourced from ScanNet [18], ScanNet++ [76], and ARKitScenes [4].

Furthermore, we enhance the video dataset by sampling two-thirds\nof the data from VLM-3R [22], reorganizing it into a multi-turn format rather than a single-turn format. With the introduction of the VST-P dataset, the VLM exhibits significantly enhanced fundamental capabilities\nin comprehending spatial relationships. Notably, there is a ∼20% improvement on CVBench-3D [60], a ∼5%\nincrease on BLINK [23], and a ∼16% gain on VSIBench [72], as illustrated in Tables 5, 6, and 7. 2.2\nVST-Reasoning\nAs shown in Figure 2b, the VST-Reasoning (VST-R) dataset contains 135K samples with two parts: one part\nincludes CoT steps to teach the model how to reason, and the other part provides rule-checkable data used in\nonline RL to improve the reasoning ability. Besides spatial data, both parts include general data to preserve\nthe original general abilities. Most spatial reasoning samples come from multi-image scenarios, which require\nreconstructing scene details and inferring spatial relations. For the spatial reasoning samples with the CoT process, we develop a data engine, as illustrated in the\nbottom left of Figure 3. Specifically, we sample data from template-based question-answer pairs and employ a\nlarge VLM [27] as the teacher to generate detailed CoT reasoning steps.

The\ntraining process can be divided into three stages. Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning. At this stage, we incorporate the foundational spatial understanding into\nthe base model by utilizing the proposed VST-P dataset. To maintain the original capabilities of the base\nmodel, we also incorporate a portion of general multi-model data from open-source datasets [20, 33]. Assume\nthe base model is parameterized by θ, which can simultaneously process text, images, and video. For any\ngiven training sample x = [x1, . . . , xL] of length L, we employ visual tokens as the conditioning context for\ntext prediction and adopt the standard auto-regressive objective:\nLθ(x) = −\nL\nX\ni=2,xi∈text\nwi log pθ(xi | x1, . . . , xi−1),\n(1)\nThe resulting model exhibits foundational spatial perception abilities, as illustrated in Table 5, 6, and 7. Stage 2: CoT Cold Start. This stage leverages chain-of-thought (CoT) data to instruct the model utilizing\nreasoning patterns. For example, in spatial reasoning scenarios with limited viewpoints, the model first\nreconstructs the layout of the scene using text, and then reasons through the given question. To preserve the\nmodel’s reasoning ability on general tasks, we also take some general reasoning data. The training objective\nremains the same as in Equation 1. The resulting model from this stage has basic spatial reasoning capabilities\n(Table 10), which serves as the initial RL actor. Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning.

In this stage, we employ RL to further enhance the spatial reasoning\ncapabilities of the stage-2 model. For this purpose, we utilize the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nalgorithm [51], which bypasses the need for a value model by computing the relative advantage of each\nresponse within a group of responses to the same question. To facilitate this process, we curated a verification\ndataset comprising tasks related to spatial understanding, 3D object detection, and general multi-modal\nunderstanding. This dataset is categorized into four task types: multiple-choice, open-ended, OCR, and 3D\ndetection. In the GRPO framework, we employ a mixed rule-based reward to evaluate the generated responses. For a given response ˆy and its corresponding ground truth y, the overall reward function is defined as:\nR(y, ˆy) = Racc(y, ˆy) + Rformat(y, ˆy). (2)\nThis function combines an accuracy reward, Racc(·, ·), which scores the correctness of the response, with a\nformat reward, Rformat(·, ·), which incentivizes adherence to a specified output format. For multiple-choice,\n6\nopen-ended, and OCR tasks, the accuracy reward is calculated using standard evaluation protocols [24, 43,\n44, 53]. For 3D object detection tasks, the reward is a linear combination of the 3D Intersection over Union\n(IoU) score and the F1 score:\nR3d(y, ˆy) = αRiou(y, ˆy) + (1 −α)RF1(y, ˆy)),\n(3)\nwhere α is a hyperparameter that defaults to 0.5.

To this end, we\nadapt the pretrained VLM into a VLA model, following the methodology of OpenVLA [31], as illustrated in\nFigure 4. Specifically, we formulate the action prediction problem as a vision-language task where, given an\nobservation image and a natural language instruction, the model auto-regressively predicts the actions. To\naccomplish this, we discretize the action space into 256 bins, where each bin corresponds to a special token in\nthe language tokenizer. With the actions tokenized, the entire model is fine-tuned using the objective function\ndefined in Eq 1. 4\nExperiment\nIn this section, we first outline our experimental setup, detailing the training and evaluation protocols. Following this, we compare our model’s performance against leading methods across several key benchmarks. Finally, we conclude with a detailed analysis of data effectiveness, the impact of data and model scaling, and\nother ablation studies. 4.1\nImplementation Details\nStage 1. The initial training stage aims to establish a strong foundation of spatial understanding capabilities. For this stage, we use a global batch size of 128, a sequence length of 16, 384, and a dynamic data packing\nstrategy to accelerate the training process.

The model is finetuned for 2.5K steps and 10K on the LIBERO benchmark [35]\nin total. Evaluation. For our evaluation, we assess spatial understanding across three distinct modalities: single-image\nability is benchmarked with CVBench [60] and 3DSRBench [41], multi-image ability with BLINK [23] and\nMMSI-Bench [75], and video-based ability with VSIBench [72]. The average score (S-AVG) across these\nbenchmarks is then calculated to quantify the model’s overall spatial understanding capabilities. To verify its\ngeneral multi-modal understanding, we also report the average score (MM-AVG) across a suite of standard\nbenchmarks: MMStar [12], MMBench [38], RealworldQA [66], MMMU [79], OCRBench [39], and AI2D [30]. For 3D object detection, we evaluate the model on both the SUN RGB-D [54] validation set (Total3D\nversion [46]) and the ARKitScenes [4] test set (Omni3D version [7]).

Detailed results are reported in Table 3. Without\nany specialized 3D encoder, VST-7B-RL delivers the best overall average among comparable VLMs, achieving\n61.2. Although VLM-3R-7B [22] attains a similar score, it relies on an additional expert 3D encoder, whereas\nVST operates with a standard vision backbone. Beyond the overall average, VST shows clear strengths on\nfine-grained spatial sub-tasks: it leads in Object Size and Room Size estimation, and performs strongly in\nRelative Direction and Appearance Order. These gains reveal that VST’s visuospatial training enables robust\nmetric and ordinal reasoning over scenes, even without explicit 3D features. Although VST-SFT models\nobtain only moderate results on general benchmarks—scoring 83.3 for the 7B size and 80.9 for the 3B size\non MMBench [38], and 84.9 and 82.5 on AI2D [30], slightly below proprietary state of the art—they still\nprovide a well-balanced overall performance.

Our baseline model is the Qwen2.5-VL-3B fine-tuned on a general\ndataset of 800K samples. From this baseline, we incrementally introduce different types of data to enhance its\ncapabilities. The results are recorded in Table 5. Given that the baseline model already possesses the 2D\nperception ability, our initial goal is to endow it with 3D spatial awareness by incorporating the 3D object\ndetection task, using only monocular RGB inputs. Introducing these 3D object detection data improves the\nperformance on spatial understanding benchmarks by 1.0%. Notably, this data leads to a 5.7% improvement\non CVBench-3D [60], demonstrating that the model has successfully acquired foundational 3D perception\nskills from the detection task. However, the model fails to generalize these newly learned 3D representations\nto other tasks, i.e., the model exhibits only marginal improvements or a slight degradation in performance on\nother benchmarks.

The second task utilizes scene captioning data, which primarily\ndescribes the spatial relationships between objects within an image. This addition resulted in a 2.3% overall\nimprovement on spatial understanding benchmarks, with specific gains of 11% on CVBench-3D [60], 1.7% on\n3DSRBench [41], and 2.1% on VSIBench [72]. Third, we introduce measurement data to inject priors for an\nobject’s length, width, and height, which obtains a 0.8% improvement on 3DSRBench [41]. Surprisingly, this\nmeasurement priors also generalized to video tasks, yielding a 2.4% improvement on VSIBench [72]. The final\nauxiliary task incorporated depth data.

Scaling up model size yields consistent gains in spatial benchmarks, whereas for 3D object detection,\nperformance improvements saturate at the 7B model. We further investigate the relationship between model\nsize and spatial understanding performance, as shown in Table 8. Increasing the model size from 3B to 7B\nresults in a 1.3% improvement in average scores on spatial understanding benchmarks. Further increasing the\nmodel size to 32B yields a 1.7% improvement in average scores on these benchmarks. These results suggest\nthat larger models achieve greater improvements on spatial understanding tasks. The relationship between model size and 3D object detection is presented in Table 9. When increasing the\nmodel size from 3B to 7B, we observe a 4.2 AP improvement on SUN RGB-D [54] and a 3.5 AP improvement\non ARKitScenes [4]. However, when increasing the model size from 7B to 32B, the performance does not\nexhibit a positive correlation as seen in the spatial understanding benchmarks. This may be because a model\nwith 7B parameters is already sufficient to handle this fundamental perception task. Data scaling boosts performance for all models, yet larger models gain more on spatial benchmarks while\nsmaller models benefit most on 3D object detection.

Recently, Large Vision–Language Models (LVLMs) have become a pivotal\ntechnology in artificial intelligence, able to understand and integrate information across multiple modalities such\n13\nas text, images, and video. Most LVLMs use the same efficient architecture [3, 13, 20, 33, 37, 62]. Specifically,\na pre-trained vision encoder is employed to extract visual embeddings, which are subsequently projected into\nthe language space via a projector composed of multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers. Various strategies have\nbeen implemented to enhance the performance of VLMs, including the utilization of more advanced vision\nencoders [14, 80], increasing input resolution [13, 36], adopting dynamic resolution techniques [62], refining\nmultimodal positional embeddings [3, 71], and synthesizing high-quality training datasets [16, 33]. Additionally,\nsome works [5, 74] aim to develop LVLMs as unified models that consolidate vision and language capabilities.", "start_char": 50847, "end_char": 52729, "source_path": "data\\2511.05491v1.pdf"}

Additionally,\nsome works [5, 74] aim to develop LVLMs as unified models that consolidate vision and language capabilities. Moreover, some studies [29, 45, 70] explore the use of reinforcement learning in the post-training stage to\nenhance the visual reasoning capabilities of LVLMs, an approach inspired mainly by DeepSeek-R1 [26]. The\nmajority of these works apply Generalized Reinforcement Learning from Preference Optimization (GRPO) [51]\nto train LVLMs, achieving significant improvements in many tasks. Large Vision-Language Models for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning. Despite the remarkable progress\nof current LVLMs in visual tasks [38, 39, 44, 67, 79], numerous benchmarks [41, 72, 75] have highlighted\npersistent challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning. To address these issues, SpatialVLM [11]\npioneered the application of VLMs to spatial understanding by constructing VQA datasets using expert\nmodels. Similarly, SpatialRGPT [15] expanded RGB-based spatial understanding to the RGB-D domain by\ngenerating spatial datasets from 3D scene graphs. Recognizing the prohibitive cost of collecting and annotating\nreal-world data, SAT [49] employed simulators to generate training data, thereby extending its focus from\nstatic to dynamic tasks. SpatialBot [9] enables VLMs to invoke external tools for depth estimation, thereby\nimproving their ability to interpret spatial information in input images. Subsequent studies [19, 21, 68, 82] have\nfurther advanced the field by constructing more comprehensive datasets to enhance the spatial understanding\ncapabilities of VLMs. In parallel, another line of research focuses on enhancing the spatial reasoning abilities of\nVLMs. For example, MVoT [65] leverages multimodal representations within its reasoning traces to strengthen\nspatial reasoning.", "start_char": 52529, "end_char": 54417, "source_path": "data\\2511.05491v1.pdf"}

SpaceR [47] and MindCube [77] incorporate textual cognition maps into their reasoning\ntraces to enhance spatial reasoning, further improving performance through reinforcement learning. Similarly,\nSpatialreasoner [42] performs spatial reasoning by predicting 3D locations and poses as intermediate results. VILASR [64] enhances spatial reasoning by incorporating visual tools and introducing visual prompting into\nthe reasoning process. In contrast to these prior studies, which typically focus exclusively on either spatial\nunderstanding or spatial reasoning, our approach begins with foundational capabilities and builds upon them\nto enhance the model’s overall reasoning skills. 6\nConclusion\nWe present Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a general and scalable framework that endows vision-language\nmodels with human-like spatial perception and reasoning abilities. With the large-scale perception data\n(VST-P) and curated reasoning instructions (VST-R), VST effectively acquires spatial awareness without\ndegrading general capabilities. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\nspatial benchmarks, demonstrating that spatial abilities in foundation models can be systematically scaled. Moreover, the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proven to enhance visuospatial skills, enabling\nmore grounded interaction with the physical world. The generality, scalability, and effectiveness of VST\nhighlight a promising direction toward building physical AI systems that reason and act in space with\nhuman-like intelligence. 14\nReferences\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo\nAlmeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

In CoRL,\n2023. 19\nAppendix\nA\nMore Implementation Details\nA.1\nCoordinate\nCamera coordinate. We define the camera coordinate system based on the right-hand rule. The camera\ncenter is taken as the origin, with the X-axis pointing to the right (parallel to the image plane), the Y-axis\npointing downward (also parallel to the image plane), and the Z-axis pointing forward along the optical axis. Bounding box coordinate. Within the defined camera system, a 3D bounding box is specified by its center\ncoordinates (x, y, z), its size (xl, yl, zl), and its orientation (pitch, yaw, roll). In our convention, the X-\ndimension corresponds to the front–back size of the box, Y represents the vertical extent, and Z denotes the\nlateral (side) extent. In our definition of a 3D bounding box, the X-axis points to the front, the Y-axis points\ndownward, and the Z-axis points sideways. The rotation angles are defined as the transformations from the\ncamera axes to the box axes, measured in degrees and normalized by π (i.e., divided by 180◦). The center\nand dimension are given in meters. All values are rounded to two decimal places. A.2\nInstruction Format\nThe CoT Format\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.

B\nMore Results\nData scaling of spatial foundational tasks. To enable the VLM to perceive the positions of objects in\n3D space, we selected monocular 3D object detection and depth estimation as our foundational tasks. We\nthen incrementally scaled the volume of training data to validate the VLM’s emerging spatial perception\ncapabilities. We use Qwen2.5-VL-3B [3] as a baseline model. As shown in Figure 5a, the AP@15 on the\nSUN RGB-D [54] and ARKitScenes [4] datasets progressively improved as the amount of 3D detection data\nincreased, demonstrating its ability to learn how to perceive the 3D spatial positions of objects from visual\ninput. Furthermore, by gradually introducing depth-related data, we discovered that the VLM could learn to\njudge the relative distances between objects and the camera, even with a comparatively small amount of data,\nas illustrated in Figure 5b.

From the printer’s position (back right near the door), the\ndesk is in front of it-closer to the camera. The bottle is on the part of the desk that’s to the left of the printer\n(since the desk extends from the foreground to the back wall, and the printer is on a cabinet against the back\nwall to the right of the desk). So, from the printer’s view: the bottle is to the left (the same direction as north, since north is toward the\ntrash can on the left) and forward (since the desk is closer than the trash can). Combining these, the bottle is\nin the northwest direction from the printer. That matches option D. Table 18 An example to illustrate the prompting with BEV annotation. 2D location.

Panning to the left\nAnswer\n<think>1. First, I need to recall what pan right and pan left mean. When the camera pans right, from its\nperspective, the scene shifts to the left. This means objects on the left side of the first frame may move out of\nview, and new objects on the right side may appear. When the camera pans left, the scene shifts to the right,\nwith right-side objects moving out and left-side new objects appearing. 2. Now, I’ll compare the two images. In image-1, on the left side, there’s a bright area with what seems to be a doorway or sliding door structure. In image-2, this left-side doorway structure is no longer visible. That indicates that the part of the scene\nthat was on the left in image-1 has moved out of the frame, which is a sign of a rightward pan. 3.
